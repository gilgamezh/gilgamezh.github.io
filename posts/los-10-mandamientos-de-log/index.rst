    **The 10 Commandments of Logging**

    Welcome on my blog for this new Year. After writing an answer to a thread 
    regarding monitoring and log monitoring on the Paris devops mailing list, 
    I thought back about a blog post project I had in mind for a long time.

    I wrote this blog post while wearing my Ops hat and this is mostly 
    addressed to developers.

    Knowing how and what to log is, to me, one of the hardest task a software 
    engineer will have to solve. Mostly because this task is akin to 
    divination. It’s very hard to know what information you’ll need during 
    troubleshooting... That’s the reason I hope those 10 commandments will help 
    you enhance your application logging for the great benefits of the 
    ops engineers :)
