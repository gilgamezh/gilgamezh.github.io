I wanted to share a little piece that still makes me smile. Back on July 6, 2017, the awesome folks over at the `PythonBytes podcast <https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/33/you-should-build-an-alexa-skill>`_ (which, by the way, is hands down my favorite Python podcast—seriously, if you're not already tuning in, `do it now <https://pythonbytes.fm/>`_) gave a shoutout to a Python library that I'm particularly fond of: **Fades**.

For those who might not know, `Fades <https://github.com/PyAr/fades/>`_ (which stands for **FAst DEpendencies for Scripts**) is a tool that automatically handles Python dependencies for your scripts, so you can just focus on writing code without worrying about the setup. It's a project I help maintain, and seeing it get highlighted on such a popular platform was a huge moment for me.

The episode in question is `Episode 33: You Should Build an Alexa Skill <https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/33/you-should-build-an-alexa-skill>`_, and it covers a ton of cool Python-related stuff. But the Fades mention? That was definitely the cherry on top for me.

If you're a Pythonista looking for a way to make your script development a bit smoother, I highly recommend giving Fades a try. And if you're into Python news and updates, go ahead and subscribe to PythonBytes—trust me, it's worth it.
