I am currently working in Ops team at Compa√±ia de Medios Digitales, 
handling the full web stack and the e-commerce backend software.
I am involved in the whole life cycle of the products including architecture 
design, deploy, performance, monitoring, tuning and support. Principally 
focused in high availability, reliability, and group work with developers, 
QA and product owners.

I am also working as a freelancer developing web sites and as a SysAdmin at 
the Numerical Astrophysics Group, IAFE-CONICET.

I am a passionate person and I love to work with and in Free Software 
projects. GNU/Linux is my favorite platform but I also have a lot of 
experience in Wintel ones.

I have always been a proactive person, mostly self-taught, but I have 
taken different courses.

Nowadays I am interested in DevOps, Infrastructure as Code and Python 
development.
Any time I have the opportunity I go to install fests, open source events 
or take part in some local community. Python Argentina is my favorite one.

I love to take pictures and read, I am into Volleyball and I am an 
English student.
