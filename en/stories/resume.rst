I'm a self taught developer, frustrated CS student. 
I had worked with computers the last 15 years. Mostly as a SysAdmin/SysOps and 
currently as a Python Developer at Satellogic[0].

I have always been a proactive person, mostly self-taught, but I have 
taken different courses.
More at my linkedin profile: http://ar.linkedin.com/in/nicolasdemarchi/en

and I love to work with and in Free Software 
projects. GNU/Linux is my favorite platform but I also have a lot of 
experience in Wintel ones.

I am a passionate person, Free Software user and activist. Member of 
Python Argentina[1] and organizer of the BsAs Python Meetup.[2] 
I'm also doing the SysAdmin work for the Python Argentina Community. 
Along with @facundobatista I'm one of the creators of Fades[3]

I love to take pictures[4], travel and camping.

You can usually reach me in Freende as gilgamezh.
